  3. The backend receives the form data and forwards it to a designated Google Workspace email.
  4. A confirmation message is sent back to the user.

- **Blog Content Retrieval**:
  1. The frontend sends a GET request to the backend API.
  2. The API fetches blog data from the MongoDB database.
  3. Blog content is rendered dynamically on the website.

#### Business Dashboard:
- **Google Drive Integration**:
  1. The dashboard sends an API request to Google Drive to fetch files.

  3. The dashboard renders the files in a table or grid view.

- **Charts and Data Visualization**:
  1. The dashboard sends an API request for financial or project data.

  3. Processed data is sent back to the frontend, where Chart.js or D3.js visualizes it.

- **GitHub Integration**:
  1. The dashboard sends an API request to GitHub to fetch repository data.
  2. GitHub API responds with commit history, branches, and pull requests.
  3. The dashboard displays the data with links to GitHub.
