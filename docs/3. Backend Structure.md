### 2. Architecture

#### Type: RESTful Architecture
- The backend will use REST APIs to ensure a stateless, flexible, and scalable system.
- APIs will handle all data exchange between the frontend and the server, focusing on modularity and simplicity.

#### Layers:
1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - API endpoints that interact with the frontend (React.js).

2. **Application Layer**:
   - Server-side business logic and processes.
   - Handles requests, authentication, and data processing.

3. **Data Layer**:
   - Database management for storing user data, financial records, project milestones, and more.
